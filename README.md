# PC-FX_Bios_Patches

Useful patches for the PC-FX BIOS

## Overview

First, it is important to be aware that the PC-FX BIOS did NOT
remain consistent across the lifetime of the system; there are
at least two versions of the BIOS.

The more common version of the BIOS was found on most PC-FX consoles
built before late 1995, and is the likely version which people use
on emulators.

As such, you will need to check in the list below whether the patch
is intended for a speicifc BIOS version.
